**Studio 11 Internship Assignment**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project is part of the **AI Internship at Studio 11 Productions**,
where we developed a Generative AI tool to **automatically place
e-commerce product images into realistic lifestyle images**. The
implementation is based on the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** from
Meta AI and runs using **free and open-source tools**.

**📂 Project Files**

-   **studio11.py** - Python script for image segmentation and
    placement.

-   **SampleImg.png** - Product image (wall painting used in this
    example).

-   **Living room.png** - Lifestyle image where the product is placed.

-   **README.md** - Instructions for running the project.

**🚀 Features Implemented**

✅ **Batch Processing** - Supports multiple product images.\
✅ **Realistic Placement** - Ensures accurate positioning & blending.\
✅ **Preserves Product Details** - Keeps the original product clarity.\
✅ **Uses Open-Source Tools** - SAM Model, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib.\
✅ **Optimized for Colab & Local** - Works on both environments.
