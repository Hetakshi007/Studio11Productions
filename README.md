
This project is a Generative AI tool that automatically places e-commerce product images into realistic lifestyle scenes. It seamlessly integrates product images while preserving details, scale, and perspective.

üìå Features
‚Ä¢	Batch Processing: Handles multiple product images at once.
‚Ä¢	Realistic Placement: Ensures natural lighting, perspective, and scale.
‚Ä¢	Preserves Product Details: Maintains clarity and integrity of the original product.
‚Ä¢	Flexible Adjustments: Allows resizing and positioning customization.
